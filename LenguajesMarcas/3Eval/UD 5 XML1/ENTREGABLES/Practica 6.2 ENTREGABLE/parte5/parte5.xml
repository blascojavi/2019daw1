        <BODY>
            The purpose of Linux Mint is to produce a modern, elegant and comfortable operating system 
            which is both powerful and easy to use. Linux Mint is one of the most popular desktop Linux distributions and used by millions of people.
            Some of the reasons for the success of Linux Mint are:
            It works out of the box, with full multimedia support and is extremely easy to use.
            It's both free of cost and open source.
            It's community-driven.
            Users are encouraged to send feedback to the project so that their ideas can be used to improve Linux Mint.
            Based on Debian and Ubuntu, it provides about 30,000 packages and one of the best software managers.
            It's safe and reliable. Thanks to a conservative approach to software updates, 
            a unique Update Manager and the robustness of its Linux architecture, Linux Mint requires very little maintenance 
            (no regressions, no antivirus, no anti-spyware...etc).

        <BODY>The virus most often spreads through people who have symptoms.
            But it may be possible to pass it on without showing any signs. 
            Some people who don't know they've been infected can give it to others. This is called asymptomatic spread. 
            You can also pass it on before you notice any signs of infection, called presymptomatic spread.
            Community Spread Sometimes, a person can trace how they got the virus because 
            they know that they've been in contact with someone who's sick. 
            In other cases, the cause is unknown. 
            Community spread is when someone gets the virus without any known contact with a sick person.
